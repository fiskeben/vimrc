# vim

This is my vim setup.

## Installation

Clone it to your home directory, preferably in a hidden folder:

`git clone git@github.com:fiskeben/vimrc.git .vim`

Symlink the `vimrc` file to `~/.vimrc`:

`ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vim`

## Credits

The theme is [Tomorrow Night](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme).
